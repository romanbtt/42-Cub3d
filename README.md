# Cub3d

This project is about to reproduce the ray casting technique used by John Romero during the development of the mythic game Wolfenstein 3D.

The minilbx library is used as a graphic library.
All the textures of the walls, the sprite, the colors of celling and floor, the resolution and the map itself can be changed using the *.cub file inside the maps folder.

**W**, **S**, **A**, **D** are used to move the player in the maze.\
**Right arrow**, **left arrow** are used to rotate the player.\
**Esc** is used to quit the game.\

Examples of use :\
**./cub3D maps/map.cub** will launch the game\
**./cub3D maps/map.cub --save** will save the first image of the game without run the game.\
